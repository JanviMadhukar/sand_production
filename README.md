# 🛢️ Sand Production Prediction Using Machine Learning

A petroleum engineering + machine learning project that predicts **sand production in oil wells** using synthetic data generation, multiple ML algorithms, and feature importance analysis.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Sand production is a major challenge in petroleum engineering that can damage equipment, reduce production, and increase costs.  
This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can be applied to **predict sand production** based on realistic geological, rock mechanics, and operational parameters.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Generate realistic petroleum engineering dataset (synthetic but physics-based).
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Compare model performance using R², RMSE, MAE, and cross-validation.
- Interpret feature importance for engineering insights.
- Visualize results with professional plots.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Scikit-learn** (Regression, RandomForest, GradientBoosting)
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** for development

---

## 📊 Results & Visualizations
The project generates **6 plots** to explain model performance and engineering insights:

1. Model Performance (R²)
2. Model Performance (RMSE)
3. Actual vs Predicted (Best Model)
4. Feature Importance (RandomForest)
5. Residuals Plot
6. Distribution Comparison

Outputs are also saved as CSV:
- `sand_production_data.csv` → synthetic dataset  
- `feature_importance.csv` → top features influencing sand production  

---

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Domain knowledge + ML = powerful insights in petroleum engineering.  
- Random Forest provided the most useful feature importance results.  
- Flow rate, drawdown, and rock strength parameters are dominant drivers of sand production.  
- Clean visualizations make technical communication much easier.

## 🔮 Future Work
- Add more ML algorithms (XGBoost, Neural Nets).
- Hyperparameter optimization for better accuracy.
- Apply on **real field datasets** (instead of synthetic).
- Extend to **time-series prediction** of sand production decline.
